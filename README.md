This project provides a complete pipeline for downloading, processing, and analyzing how current road infrastructure is ready to support Connect and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Mapillary. It downloads road network from OSM, enriches it with traffic sign data from Mapillary, performs a *k*-Prototypes clustering to identify street types, and generates statistical reports and visualizations based on the results.

This repository is a companion to our academic research. We aim for full reproducibility, so that is the reason we are including our full results here as well. For a detailed explanation of the methodology, cluster definitions, and findings, please refer to our paper:

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Downloads street network and traffic sign data for any given city using `OSMnx` and the Mapillary API.
- **Data Conflation**: Intelligently merges data from multiple sources (OSM, Mapillary, Transit Agencies) to create a single, enriched dataset.
- **Advanced Clustering**: Uses the *k*-Prototypes algorithm to cluster street segments based on both numerical (e.g., traffic sign counts) and categorical (e.g., highway type) features.
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Organized into a series of Jupyter notebooks that handle each stage of the process from data collection to final analysis.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Generates detailed cluster profiles, city-level statistics, and regional comparisons based on World Bank classifications.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Setup

**A. Create an Environment:**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

**B. Requirements:**

This project was developed using **Python 3.9**. It is recommended to use the same version to ensure compatibility with the specified library versions.

All required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please note: at the time of research, we had to use a Mapillary SDK that was not being updated for 2 years. Therefore, for compatibility, we had to also use old versions of common libraries, such as `pandas` and `numpy`. Mapillary team finally updated their library, but we did not test it nor upgraded the requirements in order to not break anything.

**C. Handle API Key (very important!)**

This project requires a Mapillary API token to download Mapillary data (not required for notebooks 2 and 3). For security, it should not be stored directly in the code.

For that, please create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
Add your token to this file like so:

```bash
MLY_ACCESS_TOKEN="MLY|your_long_token_here"
```
To get a Client Access Token you will need to register an application on https://www.mapillary.com/dashboard/developer

### 2. Workflow
1. If you would like to try the code and generate data by yourself, before running any code, please delete `results/` and `data/` folders. The code will read those files, and if they exist, it will skip any data download/generation. Also, if you wish only to read the full results, or do not wish to run everything again, please download the extra files pointed at `results/links_to_download_full_results.txt` (we could not upload these heavy files here in Github).

2. Please change the user agent in this line, using a very specific name for your project:

`geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="cav-road-typology-your-name"`

If you do not do that, you risk OSM preventing you accessing the data.

3. Change the cities/regions you would like to download in these two lines (first notebook):

`# --- Fallback Dictionary (Option 1) ---`

`if __name__ == "__main__":`

You can use the code with other cities, but also neighborhoods as well. It can work with entire countries, but it might take a huge time, and is not guaranteed to work. If the area boundary is not mapped in OSM, you can put a `.geojson` file containing the boundary inside `input_data/manual_boundaries/` folder. For statistics to proper work with the cities you would like, you will likely have to change `core_city_to_region_map = {` part in the third notebook.

4. Run the notebooks in numerical order from the `notebooks/` directory.

**01_main_data_processing.ipynb**: This notebook downloads all raw data for the specified cities, processes it, and saves the cleaned, individual city networks to the `data/` folder and the combined network to the `results/` folder.

**02_clustering_all_features.ipynb** and **03_clustering_filtered.ipynb**: These two notebook loads the combined network (generated in the previous notebook), performs *k*-Prototypes clustering to find street types, and saves the final clustered dataset to the `results/` folder. All clustering figures (elbow method, silhouette plots) are saved to `results/figures/clustering/`. The only difference between them is that in the first file, all features are used, and since we identified they were not significant, we tweaked the features (better explained in the paper), and used the new features in the 03_clustering_filtered notebook.

Note: if you are running full data (7 millions segments), it is very likely you will run out of RAM for the Silhouette method. Therefore, we recommend running on a sample (`Determining Optimal k using the Silhouette Method on a Sample`part). Feel free to tweak the range of *k* values and the sample size. 

**04_statistics_and_viz.iynb**: This notebook loads the clustered data and performs a statistical analysis. It generates cluster profiles, city-level reports, and regional comparisons, saving all outputs to the `results/` and `results/figures/statistics/` folders.

## License

This project uses a dual-license model:

*   The **data** (all files inside `data/` and `input_data/manual_boundaries/` folders) is licensed under the **[Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)](LICENSE_DATA)**, since these files are derived from OpenStreetMap.

*   Everything else, including the **source code** (`.ipynb` notebooks), is licensed under the **[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](LICENSE)**.

## Development and Reproducibility Notes

### Development Process
This project was developed with significant assistance from Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate tasks such as code generation, refactoring, and debugging. All key logic has been reviewed and validated.

### Versioning and Compatibility
The Python data science ecosystem, especially within the geospatial domain, is highly sensitive to library versions. A combination of packages that works today might produce errors or warnings in the future as individual libraries are updated.

This project was confirmed to be fully functional in **July 2025** using **Python 3.9**.

To ensure you can reproduce the results, it is **essential** to:
1.  Use a **virtual environment** to isolate project dependencies.
2.  Install the exact package versions specified in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
